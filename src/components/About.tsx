        starting with writing basic html, batch scripts during my primary school
        years. I'm currently focused on full stack development. I have no
        problem with writing backend code in <b>Python</b>, <b>NodeJS</b> but
        I'm also comfortable with frontend technologies like{' '}
        <b>React and NextJS</b>. Whether it is <b>cyber security</b>,{' '}
        <b>testing automation</b> or CI/CD technologies like <b>Docker</b> and{' '}
        <b>Github Actions</b> I'm always eager to learn new things. I'm
        proficient in <b>Python</b> and <b>TypeScript</b>, but I've also had
        some experience with <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>C#</b>.
